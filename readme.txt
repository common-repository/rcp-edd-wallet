== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How does the deposit work? =
You define the amount to be deposited by editing a subscription level and defining the amount. The amounts are deposited each subscription period. If a member has a recurring subscription, that member's wallet will have funds deposited into it when the next subscription payment is made.

= Can I define a fixed deposit amount that does not renew when a subscription renews? =
Not at this time. If you'd like this feature, let us know.
